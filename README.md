# Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Projects

Welcome to my Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) project repository! 🧠🔄  
This collection contains my exploration and implementation of LSTMs—advanced Recurrent Neural Networks capable of learning long-term dependencies in sequential data.

## 📚 Overview

- **LSTM Fundamentals:**  
  Hands-on examples and explanations of how LSTM networks overcome the limitations of traditional RNNs.
- **Applications Covered:**  
  - Sequence classification and prediction
  - NLP tasks (e.g. text generation, sentiment analysis)
  - Time series forecasting (stock prices, weather, etc.)
- **Milestone in Learning Path:**  
  This project marks a major step in my AI/ML and Deep Learning journey.

## 🛠️ Features

- Core LSTM network implementations (from scratch and with Keras/PyTorch)
- Experiments using real datasets
- Extensive code comments/supporting markdowns for easy understanding
- Visualization of training results and predictions
- Hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation
